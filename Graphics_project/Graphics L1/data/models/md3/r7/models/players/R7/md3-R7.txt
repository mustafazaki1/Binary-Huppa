Special Thanks to Gwot for helping me get the mesh finalized and more 
feminine. And big thanks to Wrath and Tone on the polycount message board 
for helping with tag_torso issues regarding 3DS Max R3.  You guys rule.  :)

Origin, adapted from Rorshach's specs:

This is R7 , she is one COLD bitch. She's a Vampiric Fallen Angel with horns 
and the tallest of the HH3 models. In the arenas, her race is ironically 
referred to as 'The Kindly Ones'. R7's motto is "The weak must be culled,"  
and she's risen high amongst her peers in this code of ethics. <For more 
info on R7's race and HeadHunters III in general, be sure to visit: 
http://tarot.telefragged.com/hh3/ >
 
Her name is easily translated to 'Arse Heaven' in Britain. This won't be 
appreciated by everyone from other countries but perhaps more than I think 
will see the funny side.
 
Her back has 2 stumps, which are all that remain of her wings. These were
perhaps torn of in battle or burned off during her expulsion from heaven, 
the truth is known only to her...
 

Model Info:

I was sort of a "hired gun" working on models for HeadHunters III, and R7 
was my assigned character. She was supposed to be released with the mod, 
so I held onto her even after she was finished. But since it's been awhile
that she's complete, and the HH3 still hasn't been released, I asked them 
if I could release her on her own. The answer was yes (or you wouldn't be
reading this). R7 was the first female humanoid model I ever made, and also 
the first model I ever animated using 3DS Max & Character Studio. Given that, 
I'm pretty happy with how she turned out. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but 
pretty solid in all areas. Note that the 1st and 2nd Level-Of-Detail models
are the same. I did this because I'd seen problems some modelers had with 
their characters noticably switching from the 1st to 2nd LOD models because 
the switching cutoff point was too close to the player's view. I didn't want 
that for R7, and justified it because the 1st LOD polycount was under 900.


Skin Info:

I love Rorshach's base R7 skin, it makes the model come alive. The other skins 
are basically variations on the base skin, with some different colors, names, 
faces, and scars (heh). I think it'd be interesting to see some enterprising 
skinners use shaders to make her horns, stumps, shoulder guard, and arm/leg 
"flares" invisible. This would give you a pretty generic female model, albeit bald.


Bot Info:

R7 speaks to other members of her "race" through telepathy and a series of
hisses. Since that wouldn't convey too well for the bot, I did give her some
actual dialogue. However, her "English" is very broken, as if she only speaks
it when she has to in order to admonish opponents who don't understand her 
native language. She still hisses, and isn't as talkative as the other bots
in the game. I think her character is kept intact overall. As for her fighting 
skills, I started with Hunter's botfile and tweaked it a little, in many cases 
ramping her abilities up slightly. R7 is no pushover.

=======================================================================

Installation and Usage:

Unzip the files to the baseq3 folder under your Quake3 folder.  This will put 
"md3-R7.pk3" and "md3-R7.txt" in the baseq3 folder. It will also create a
models/players/R7/ folder with the "md3-R7.txt" in that as well. I did this 
because R7 doesn't seem to show up in the player model selection screen unless
there is a specific player model folder created for her. I don't know why some 
models need this, but R7 seems to be one of them. When you start Quake3 again R7
and her ilk will appear in your model selection menu.  You can also choose to 
use R7 as a bot (only the base R7 character is supported for this).

=======================================================================

Issues:

- Some clipping issues with the right arm during the gesture and death
animations.  During the gesture, her right arm pushes through the shoulder
guard. Kinda want to fix it, kinda want to move on...

- I had seen a lot of models with stretched mapping on the head, so I 
experimented with mapping the top of R7's head separately. This didn't work
out so well in the end, as it made skinning the head very hard: getting the
the skin to smoothly transition from one piece to another gave Rorshach many 
headaches. So note to all modelers: don't try this at home!! 

- The upper body doesn't animate during idle. At first I wasn't sure if you 
could animate this or not, since the id models didn't seem to make use of it.
I did then see player models come out that had idle animations. But after a 
lot of thought, I decided to skip it because the cold stillness R7 showed 
actually fit her better than if I'd animate her looking around or doing 
something during idle. She's very stern and disciplined - every movement I 
considered adding just seemed to be out of character for her.

- The Gauntlet weapon looks backwards in the player control setup, but it's 
right in the actual game.
